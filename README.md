Syllabi Map
===========

### Business Understanding
----
With the development of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) education is
more accessible than ever nowadays. You can learn almost anything you
set out for online but... Where to start? There are so many courses of
varying difficulties out there that a simple google search for them isn't
enough. Syllabi Map will ask for user preferences like field of study and
expertise and will attempt to map a sensical course sequence for you to
follow.

### Data Understanding
----
There are several online course websites they all have some sort of course
description as well as reviews written for them. Some even have more
detailed fields that classify their courses.

In addition to this, there is a site that aggregates courses from many
sources. This is where I'll start.

### Data Preparation
----
After scraping these sites I will attempt to cluster courses together
and see if these clusters create a sensical separation of topics

### Modeling
----
TF-iDF, NMF, and clustering, content based filtering recommender.

### Evaluation
----
I will have friends test it out (?)

### Deployment
----
The MVP for this project is going to be a website where you input
preferences and options are displayed to you. Things to work on later
would include keeping track of user's learning progress and dynamically
adjusting the syllabi tailored to the user's career progression
